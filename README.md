# Introduction
I originally did this project as part of a course I found on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/m_u6P5k0vP0) for React and Firebase, it was hosted on the [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) channel.

## Refactoring
As the course used a lot of classes I decided to refactor it all to use React hooks as a way of learning hooks and how they work with state management modules like Redux.

## installed packages
    1. @material-ui/core
    2. @material-ui/icons
    3. axios
    4. dayjs
    5. jwt-decode
    6. react-redux
    7. react-router-dom
    8. redux
    9. redux-thunk

use git to clone or download the repository
`npm install`
